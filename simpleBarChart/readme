I have kept the steps separate to make this example as clear as possible:

The access token can be setup and retrieved from: https://www.strava.com/settings/api

Retrieve a user activities as a json string:

$ node loadActivities.js  > data.json

Format the json data as a csv file. Sum all the distances for a given day:

$ node distancePerDay.js data.json > data.csv

Display a bar chart of the distances per day:

barChart.html
